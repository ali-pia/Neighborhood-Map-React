To serve assets from local cache a **service worker** is registered in production. Service worker lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives it offline capabilities. However, it also means that developers (and users) will only see deployed updates on the "N+1" visit to a page, since previously cached resources are updated in the background.
To learn more about the benefits of this model, read [https://goo.gl/KwvDNy](https://goo.gl/KwvDNy "Service worker's Infos") (includes instructions on opting out of this behavior).
